 # Coding Style & Thought

 - Appreciate expressiveness, simplicity, minimalist
 - Sometimes tends to appreciate Functional Programming more for the reason FP leans towards a smaller chunk of logic which is very testable and composable
 - Love [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
 - Find some of [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) come in handy when solving particular problems
